stanford entity tagger : pretty good for tagging person, organization

##simple function to extract entities
def extract_entities(text):
    entities = []
    for sentence in sent_tokenize(text):
        chunks = ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(sentence)))
        entities.extend([chunk for chunk in chunks if hasattr(chunk, 'node')])
    return entities
Not giving good results
